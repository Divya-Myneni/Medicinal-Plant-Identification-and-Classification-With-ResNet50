# Medicinal-Plant-Identification-and-Classification-With-ResNet50
This study introduces "Medi Flora," an innovative deep learning model tailored for the identification of medicinal plants by analyzing their leaves. Acknowledging the significance of plant identification in healthcare, particularly within traditional medicine, this model utilizes sophisticated neural network architectures i.e., RESNET50 to discern detailed features from leaf images. The methodology encompasses meticulous dataset curation, pre-processing procedures, and intensive model training. Results showcase the effectiveness of Medi Flora in precisely identifying medicinal plants based on leaf characteristics and also diseases that can be cured through it. This novel approach not only advances herbal medicine research but also contributes to the preservation of medicinal flora and advocates for sustainable healthcare practices.
